 Have a seat. At the head of the table. That ain't the head, that's the S. Whitty. Nico, man, you guys got to stand behind me. What's your dog, honey? Well, you can watch it from anywhere, like that corner over there. What can they do, someone comes to the door, where the fuck over there, it's way. You expect a company, buddy? What's wrong with you? I thought I just don't like, guys. Stand it behind me. Please, I'm just watching. Don't stand right behind my fucking back. Just give them some space. I'm just giving you some fun. It's not a good idea. I just made a mistake. Sit it out. Not exactly the walk about with respect.
